1. JSON Extractor
User Story:
As a developer, I want to extract specific key-value pairs from JSON data so that I can isolate relevant information to be used in document generation.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given JSON input, the JSON Extractor should identify and extract data based on specified keys (e.g., question, answers).
Extracted data should be stored in a consistent dictionary format for further processing.
The extractor should be able to handle nested JSON structures and indexed keys.
Non-essential keys (e.g., metadata, unused properties) should be skipped if specified.
2. Document Converter
User Story:
As a user, I want to convert extracted JSON data, including HTML content, into a structured format so that it can be prepared for generating a document.

Acceptance Criteria:

The Document Converter should correctly interpret HTML content in JSON values and convert it to formatted text.
HTML tags (e.g., <div>, <img>, <p>) should be parsed and rendered as appropriate styles in the output format.
All converted content should be compatible with the Word document format.
Converter should handle various HTML structures gracefully and ignore unsupported or unknown HTML elements without errors.
3. Word Document Generator
User Story:
As a user, I want a generated Word document to accurately reflect structured data, including formatted questions and answers, so that it appears professional and readable.

Acceptance Criteria:

The Word Document Generator should generate a .docx file from structured data provided by the Document Converter.
Each question and answer should be formatted as a separate paragraph with clear headings.
Paragraphs should have controlled spacing, alignment, and proper line spacing, as specified by document requirements.
Document generation should support embedded images and hyperlinks within the answer content if present.
Generated documents should save under a specified file name and path.
4. Handling Multiple DLLs
User Story:
As a developer, I want the system to load and manage multiple external DLLs dynamically so that I can extend functionality without hardcoding dependencies.

Acceptance Criteria:

The system should load DLLs from a specified directory at runtime.
Loaded DLLs should be accessible for use in document generation tasks without requiring a full application restart.
The system should handle missing DLLs gracefully by logging errors or warnings without interrupting other tasks.
Loaded DLLs should allow customization of document processing based on the extracted JSON data structure and any additional processing needs.
5. Generate Filtered Document
User Story:
As a user, I want to create a secondary Word document that includes only selected key-value pairs (e.g., question and answer) so that I have a summarized version of the full document.

Acceptance Criteria:

The system should create a second document containing only question and answer pairs extracted from the JSON data.
Filtered document formatting should match the main document but omit unnecessary details.
Both documents (full and filtered) should be generated in one execution, with unique file names to avoid conflicts.
The user should be able to specify output paths for each document.

User Story:

As a user, I want the system to automatically generate unique, descriptive file names for each document so that I can easily identify and differentiate between various document versions without manually renaming them.

Acceptance Criteria:

The system should generate file names that reflect the document's content (e.g., Full_Document and Filtered_Document).
Each file name should include a timestamp or unique identifier to prevent overwriting when multiple documents are generated in one execution.
File names should follow a consistent naming convention for readability, such as DocumentType_DateTime.docx.
The user should have the option to specify a base name or prefix for the generated documents if desired.

Could you create one use story for this requirement R&D
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
User Story:

As a developer, I want to conduct R&D on implementing a solution that integrates JSON extraction, document conversion, and API data handling, so that I can evaluate and prototype the components needed for seamless document generation from dynamic API responses.

Acceptance Criteria:

Research and document methods for extracting JSON data from API responses, including testing various libraries or tools (e.g., JsonExtractor).
Explore approaches for converting extracted JSON data into structured Word documents, using OpenXML or similar libraries for document formatting.
Investigate handling HTML within JSON responses, ensuring correct parsing and formatting when incorporated into Word documents.
Identify methods for dynamically loading and managing multiple DLLs required by various components at runtime.
Produce a detailed R&D report or prototype outlining findings, challenges, and potential solutions for each component.
Evaluate the feasibility of generating a filtered document containing only specific key-value pairs (e.g., "question" and "answers") within the same execution process.

In begin requirement was not clear they told they have api endpoints and they need document.

ChatGPT
User Story:

As a developer, I need to clarify the initial requirement, where it was only specified that API endpoints would be provided to generate a document, so that I can understand the specifics of data extraction, processing, and document generation required for the solution.

Acceptance Criteria:

Engage with stakeholders to gather details on the expected document structure, key-value pairs, and any formatting or content requirements.
Determine the exact API endpoint response format and identify which data fields are needed in the final document.
Confirm any requirements for filtering data (e.g., inclusion of only "question" and "answer" fields).
Identify additional dependencies, such as handling HTML content, images, or metadata.
Develop a project outline or scope document to ensure all requirements are clear before proceeding with the development of JSON extraction, document conversion, and Word document generation components.
Obtain approval from stakeholders on the clarified requirements to proceed confidently with implementation.
